# Sovietwave Inspired Arch Rice Dotfiles
My first rice - worked on it for a few months some 2-3 years ago. I still use this as my main DE.

The wallpaper is a edited by me. Unfortunately, because I riced this so long ago, I cannot find the original image on the internet to credit the author. I have included in here a copy of the original.
### Note
I have not included in the dotfiles some binaries that ensure multi-monitor functionality, so some scripts will not work. I tried to comment out all the calls to those scripts, but be advised!

### If there is anything missing or wrong
Let me know! This is my first rice so I do not know exactly what should or shouldn't go in the dotfiles.
